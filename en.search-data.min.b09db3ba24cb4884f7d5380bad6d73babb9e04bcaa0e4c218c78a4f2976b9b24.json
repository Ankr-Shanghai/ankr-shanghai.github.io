To regain their control, the users need to replace the account’s key through account recovery.\nWith our unique on-chain email verification technology, users can set multiple internet emails as guardians of the account, which can help users achieve account recovery by simply submitting emails to smart contract on chain. This greatly lowers the requirement on guardians and allows all your family members and friends with emails to become guardians of your account.\nAA Wallet allowed the difficulty to owning and guarding a wallet account to Web2 level, giving users a smart contract account truly easy to understand, operate, and manage.\nPrivacy preserving\r#\rBecause Web2 accounts’ private account information is stored in centralized servers outsiders cannot access, in normal circumstances these private information would not be leaked. Since AA Wallet is a non-custodial smart contract wallet, even though it stores users’ sensitive information after hashing, when such information is verified on chain, it is still possible that it could be exposed.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/getting_started/quick_login/","title":"Quick Login","section":"Getting Started","content":"\rWe currently only support Google account login\rAgree Terms And Statement\r#\rYou need to agree to our terms of use and statement before you can log in\nSelect Google Account\r#\rSelect the google account you want to log in and click\nLogin Success\r#\rAfter successful login, you can see the following page\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/getting_started/import_token/","title":"Import Token","section":"Getting Started","content":"You can import your other token assets through this function\nClick Import Tokens\r#\rClick \u0026ldquo;Import tokens\u0026rdquo; to add the token you want to import\nEnter The Token Address\r#\rPaste the asset contract address you want to add in the input box and click the add button.\nToken Import Completed\r#\rNow you can see the token you imported\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/introduce/multi_chain_support/","title":"Multi Chain Support","section":"Introduce","content":"\rMulti-chain Support\r#\rAA Wallet supports all EVM-compatible chains and gives users the same address across all chains using EIP-2470.
